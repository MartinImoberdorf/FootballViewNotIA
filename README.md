FootballViewNotIA is a Unity-based project that offers a unique football match visualization experience. Unlike current trends, this project stands out by eschewing the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a world where AI is all the rage in various fields, FootballViewNotIA aims to highlight simplicity and pure appreciation of the game without algorithmic interventions.

(Only in Windows, by now)
